# Task 2 - Fragmentation of the UI into selective components
#### UI was broke down into 3 major components
- BurnButtonBar
- BurnStatsContainer
- TransactionTable
\
These are the main components handling the functionality of the UI. All have various states and functions embedded with each of the component. Passing them as the props can resolve the problem or using the state management library such as Redux may be handy. 
Depending on the element that should be render states can be managed.
